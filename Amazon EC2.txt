Introduction to Amazon EC2:-

>>To gain access to virtual servers.
>>Highly flexible, cose- effective and quick when campare to running own servers on-permises in a data centre that you own.
>>EC2 runs in top of physical host machines managed by AWS using virtualization technology.
>>A hypervisor is running on the host machine which is responsible for sharing underlying physical resources.
>>EC2 instances are also resizeable(vertically scale).

How Amazon EC2 works?

1.) LAUNCH:--

	> Begin by selecting a template with basic configurations for your instance.
	> Configuration include:- OS, Application server or application.
	> You can select the instance type i.e.,hardware configuration.
	> You can specific security settings to control the network traffic.

2.) CONNECT:--

	> Next connect to the instance through several ways.
	> Users can also connect by LOGGING IN.

3.) USE:--

	> Run commands to install software, add storage, copy and organise files and more.

Amazon EC2 instance types:-

1.) GENERAL PURPOSE- Provide a balance of compute, memory and networking resources.
					**Application servers, gaming server, backened server, small and medium database(code repositories).

2.) COMPUTE OPTIMIZED INSTANCE- Ideal for compute-bound applications.Can also use for batch processing workloads.
							   **Web, application and gaming servers, scientific modeling.

3.) MEMORY OPTIMIZED INSTANCES- Deliver fast performance for workloads that process large datasets in memory. 

4.) ACCELERATED COMPUTING INSTANCES- Use hardware accelerators or coprocessors to perform some function more efficiently.
									**Graphics application, game streaming, application streaming, data pattern matching.

5.) STORAGE OPTIMIZED INSTANCES- Requires high, sequential read and write access to large dataset on local storage.
								**Distributed file system, data warehousing application, high-frequency online transacing.
